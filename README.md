A lisp like language?

Alright, this is my first attempt at making a lisp interpreter.  It works but it is not the most elegant
software I have written.  Currently, you cannot create your own functions but you can call builtin functions
with literals as parameters.  You can even nest these function calls.

I think that I will take the lessons I have learned in this project and apply then to a potential future
iteration of my lisp like language.
